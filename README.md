# My dot files

This is my current set of dot files. I am going to migrate all necessary files and directories from former repos into this one. 

Additionally there is a `setup.sh` file to setup the whole environment based on the dot files in this directory.

## Usage

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/schaary/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    bash ./setup.sh
```
